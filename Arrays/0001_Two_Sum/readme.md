# 1. Two Sum

**Difficulty:** Easy

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that:
- Exactly one valid solution exists.
- You cannot use the same element twice.
- The answer can be returned in any order.

## Examples

### Example 1

Input:
nums = [2,7,11,15]
target = 9

Output:
[0,1]

### Example 2

Input:
nums = [3,2,4]
target = 6

Output:
[1,2]

### Example 3

Input:
nums = [3,3]
target = 6

Output:
[0,1]

## Constraints

- 2 <= nums.length <= 10⁴
- -10⁹ <= nums[i] <= 10⁹
- -10⁹ <= target <= 10⁹
- Exactly one valid answer exists.

## Approach

Use a hash map (dictionary) to store each number and its index.

For every element:
1. Calculate the complement (`target - current_number`).
2. Check whether the complement already exists in the dictionary.
3. If yes, return both indices.
4. Otherwise, store the current number and its index.
